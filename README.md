# Why we do it
## Affects people
8.5% of US population has a disability that affects computer use (including
cognitive/learning disabilities, color blindness, etc.) 
- 2000 US Census

## Market share
For some people with disabilities, the web is where they do all of their
commerce: they can't do it in person. Whoever creates accessible options wins.
E.g., big shift to iPhone once it became accessible.

## Search engine benefits
Making things more machine-readable for AT also helps search engine agents.
Google is blind and deaf and can't use a mouse.

Providing adequate accessibility makes disability transparent. E.g., people
with vision issues don't consider themselves disabled once they have glasses.
Their experience of the world isn't different. Imagine if some websites didn't
work with contacts or glasses.

## Principles
- Perceivable (content can be perceived)
- Operable (users can interact with it)
- Understandable
- Robust (technology compatibility - AT)

## Levels of conformance
- A: without this, experience will be hindered.
- AA: without this, experience will be more difficult.
- AAA: additional enhancements that go beyond what's necessary. Very few
websites are fully AAA compliant.

## Accessibility vs. compliance
Some technically compliant experiences can still be inaccessible (and provide poor UX). E.g., having to hit tab
hunderds of times to pass a big flyout menu.

## Auditory
1. Provide captions for video & live audio.
2. Provide descriptive text transcripts for audio content. If you can't hear
   the audio, you get all of the same information from the transcript: identify
   speaker, include sound effects, include visual-only information.

## Low vision
Vision that can't be adequately corrected using glasses. Blurry, obscured visual
field, difficulty in perceiving contrast, things might move/flutter.

1. Support enlarged/magnified content. People typically use magnification software such as ZoomText. In
  WebAIM survey: one third zoomed 200%, another third 400%.
  (One reason for not embedding text in images.)
2. Provide sufficient color contrast
